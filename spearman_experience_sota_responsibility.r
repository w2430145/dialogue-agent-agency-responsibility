# Generate samples from the posterior distribution of rho using spearmanGibbsSampler.
# nSamples: Number of samples to draw (more samples generally lead to better stability but take more time).
# progBar: Whether to display a progress bar during sampling.
# nBurnin: Number of burn-in samples to discard (initial unstable samples).
# nChains: Number of independent Markov chains to run (useful for convergence diagnostics).
# kappaPriorParameter: Parameter for the prior distribution (default is 1.0, as recommended in the paper).
#                      This parameter controls the spread of the prior distribution for rho.
#                      (The default a=b=1 corresponds to a uniform prior on rho).
#                      For Spearman's rho, the priorParameter is kappa (the inverse scale of the Beta distribution).
#                      The example in ExampleAnalyses.R for Spearman's rho uses the default value of 1.
